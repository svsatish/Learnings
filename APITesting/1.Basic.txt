API - Application programming interface or communication protocol b/n client and server

---------------------------------------
** Microservices vs Webservices vs APIs
- Microservices are an architectural style for web applications, where the
functionality is divided up across small web services.
- APIs are the frameworks through which developers can interact with a web application.
- Web service facilitates interaction between two machines over a network

* Summary:
- Microservices is an architecture style to build applications
- All Webservices are APIs
- Both Webservices and APIs are used for communication
- Webservices require network but APIs do not.

** Problem statement:

1. How can a partner/third party access the info/code that is being run in your
backend/server ?
2. How can an UI written in one language talk to backend written in other language ?
---------------------------------------

** Types of services:
- SOAP and REST
---------------------------------------

** API
- operations - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- endpoint - base url
- resources - collection of APIs
- path parameters - sub-resource; passed in url
- query parameters - used to sort or filter; ? in url
- headers/cookies - metadata; additional data for requests to process
