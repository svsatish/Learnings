Regions:
- is a Geographic location containing one or more availability domain (AD)
- Every region has at least one AD
- Mostly there are is a region pair for high availability, DR, data residency
- We select region based on closest location for low latency and high performance

Availability Domain:
- is a physical data center
- within a region
- can be a group of isolated data centers connected with low latency and high bandwidth network for fault tolerance
- for any location having only one AD, the second AD will be setup within an year

Fault Domain:
- is a logical data centers
- group of related hardware and infrastructure
- there are 3 FD within a AD

Compartments:
- group of related resources to isolate and control
- compartments can be nested upto 6 levels
- each resource can be only in ONE compartment but can interact with others
- resources can be moved to other compartment
- compartments is a global construct meaning resources from multi-regions can be in one compartment
- can analyze cost and assign budget easily
