-----------------------------------------
Exam: 90 min; US 100; 65 questions; min score 700/1000; immediate result
-----------------------------------------
Knowledge Check - 7 questions - answered most
-----------------------------------------
What is Cloud computing - on-demand delivery of IT resources via internet with
pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Benefits. Why customers are moving to cloud ?
- Self-managed(DB on EC2) and Fully-managed service(DB on RDS)
-----------------------------------------
Why AWS?
-----------------------------------------
Global Infrastructure:
DC- 50-80k servers in each data center - best ROI
collection of DC's - AZ - interconnected thru private n/w
collection of AZ's - Region
CloudFront - CDN - uses Edge locations(point of presence) to cache content
------------------------------------------
Shared responsibility model
customer is responsible for Security "in" Cloud
AWS is responsible for Security "of" Cloud

- AWS trusted advisor -
- AWS organizations - policy based management for multiple AWS accounts;
auto user creation, consolidated Billing
- Inspector - Vulnerability assessment; agent installed on EC2 for assessment
- Shield - DDoS; Standard & Advanced version (24x7 support from Amazon, cost protection)
- AWS artifacts - on-demand access to compliance report
---------------------------------------------
Services:

Tools for migration:
Server - VM import/export; SMS(Server migration service); AMI; Cloudendure
DB - DMS
Snowball - robust hardware - data offline transfer, 50/80/100TB
Snowball edge - can run compute too

Compute services:
EC2 - VM's running on AWS hypervisor (AWS Nitro system)
AMI/golden image - image of server/ pre-configured image
Instance types: On-demand; Reserved; RI; Spot; Dedicated; Dedicated host
Auto scaling
Pricing
ECS
Lambda

Storage services:
File - EFS/NFS; FSx/SMB
Block - EBS; EC2instance store
Object - S3; S3 Glacier
Data transfer - Direct connect; Snowball; S3 transfer acceleration; Storage
gateway; Kinesis firehouse, ISV connectors

Network services:
VPC - Multi-account strategy is preferred instead of multi-vpc in one AWS account
Security groups: EC2 - Virtual firewalls(stateful) - checks one way and remembers state
NACL: subnets - stateless - checks both ways
ELB - distributes traffic; Application, Network & Classic load balancers
CloudFront - CDN - caching content
Route 53 - DNS service - 100% SLA
API Gateway - create, publish, maintain
Transit gateway - connect b/n VPC's and on-premises too

RDS - fully managed (mysql; oracle; sql server); performance by read-replicas,
multi AZ capability
Aurora - RDS too; mysql & PostgreSQL compatibility, auto backup
Dynamo DB - NoSQL
Redshift - Data Warehousing
Amazon ElastiCache - in-memory db supports Redis and memcache

Security:
Layered security approach
IAM users, groups, policies, roles - can be assumed(granting access to access other services)
AWS Directory service - AD connector - connects on-prem AD to AWS cloud
KMS - data encryption; managed service; integrates with cloud trial and many
Cloud HSM - H/w security module - self managed
Web Application firewall (WAF) - protects web app
AWS Shield - DDoS; Standard and advanced
GuardDuty - Intelligent threat detection
Macie - Identify PII

Management:
CloudWatch - monitor resources; create alarms
CloudTrail - logging/auditing of aws account activity
CloudFormation - Infrastructure as code
AWS config - tracking inventory and config
Elastic beanstalk - deploy an manage apps

TCO and Cost Optimization:

TCO Calculator - when you want to move to aws
Cost explorer - analyze the bills based on usage and tags
Simply monthly calculator - estimate your bills
